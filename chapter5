#Exercise1: Percentage of amino acid residues, part one

#Write a function that takes two arguments – a protein sequence and an amino acid
#residue code – and returns the percentage of the protein that the amino acid makes
#up. Use the following assertions to test your function:

def my_function(protein_seq,aa):
    aa=aa.upper()
    count=0
    for i in protein_seq:
        if (i==aa):
            count +=1
    length=len(protein_seq)
    aa_percentage= int((count/length)*100)
    return(aa_percentage)

my_function("MSRSLLLRFLLFLLLLPPLP","M")
my_function("MSRSLLLRFLLFLLLLPPLP", "r") == 10

            
#Exercise2: Percentage of amino acid residues, part two

#Modify the function from part one so that it accepts a list of amino acid residues
#rather than a single one. If no list is given, the function should return the
#percentage of hydrophobic amino acid residues (A, I, L, M, F, W, Y and V). Your
#function should pass the following assertions:


hydrophobic_aa=["A", "I", "L", "M", "F", "W", "Y", "V"]

def my_function2(protein_seq,aa=hydrophobic_aa):
    count=0   
    for i in protein_seq:
      for j in aa:
        if (i==j):
          count +=1
    length=len(protein_seq)
    aa_percentage= int((count/length)*100)
    return(aa_percentage)
