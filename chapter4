#Exercise1: Processing DNA in a file
#The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence
#starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequencing adapter that should have
#been removed. Write a program that will (a) trim this adapter and write the cleaned
#sequences to a new file and (b) print the length of each sequence to the screen. 

with open("input.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()  

# Remove the last line from the list
lines = lines[:-1]

with open("trimmed.txt", "w") as output:
    for dna in lines:
        trimmed_dna = dna[14:]
        output.write(trimmed_dna)


#Exercise2: Multiple exons from genomic DNA
#The file genomic_dna.txt contains a section of genomic DNA, and the file exons.txt
#contains a list of start/stop positions of exons. Each exon is on a separate line and
#the start and stop positions are separated by a comma. Write a program that will
#extract the exon segments, concatenate them, and write them to a new file.

genomic_dna = open("genomic_dna.txt").read()
exon_locations = open("exons.txt")

coding_sequence_segments = []

for line in exon_locations:
    positions = line.split(',')
    start = int(positions[0])
    stop = int(positions[1])
    exon = genomic_dna[start:stop]
    coding_sequence_segments.append(exon)
exon_locations.close()

coding_sequence = "".join(coding_sequence_segments)

with open("coding_sequence.txt", "w") as output:
    output.write(coding_sequence)
