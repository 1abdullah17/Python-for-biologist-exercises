#Exercise1: Splitting genomic DNA
#Look in the chapter_3 folder for a file called genomic_dna.txt â€“ it contains the same
#piece of genomic DNA that we were using in the final exercise from chapter 2. Write
#a program that will split the genomic DNA into coding and non-coding parts, and
#write these sequences to two separate files.
#Hint:use your solution to the last exercise from chapter 2 as a starting point.
